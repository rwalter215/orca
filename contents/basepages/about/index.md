### Your Software Solution

Hi, I’m Ryan.
Front-end Developer for Adobe, I strive to create an easily maintainable clean code. Add
well tested and accessible, and you get the Dev bingo. I specialize in React and Node Applications.

-   Voted most likely to say “Best practices” in an everyday convo.
-   Rocking the “Austin tech” camouflage, ie. Bald, beard, and witty tatts.

### Your Copywriting Solution

![Carla](./CC2.jpg "Carla Pic")

Bonjour, I’m Carla,
the Frenchy with the smart words. But I’ll be the first to agree; sometimes, you need more than just
the right words. You need the right story and an effective strategy. Transitioning from lifestyle
journalism, I’m committed to providing sharp digital and print copywriting as well as cadenced
content that fits your company’s voice.

-   Born and raised in Paris and still weirdly winning popularity contests.
-   Published non-fiction author and branding obsessed.
